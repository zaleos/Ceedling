# Reminder: 6 qualities of a good user story
1. **Independent:** We want to be able to develop in any sequence.
2. **Negotiable:** Avoid too much detail; keep things flexible so the team can adjust how much of the story to implement.
3. **Valuable:** Users or customers get some value from the story.
4. **Estimable:** The team must be able to use the story for planning.
5. **Small:** Large stories are harder to estimate and plan. By the time of iteration planning, the story should be designed, coded and tested within the iteration.
6. **Testable:** Ensure the team understands acceptance criteria and the definition of “done,” which includes completion testing procedures
