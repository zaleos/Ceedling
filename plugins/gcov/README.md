ceedling-gcov
=============

# Plugin Overview

Plugin for integrating GNU GCov code coverage tool into Ceedling projects.
Currently only designed for the gcov command (like LCOV for example). In the
future we could configure this to work with other code coverage tools.

This plugin currently uses `gcovr` to generate HTML and/or XML reports as a
utility. The normal gcov plugin _must_ be run first for this report to generate.

## Installation

Gcovr can be installed via pip like so:

```
pip install gcovr
```

## Configuration

The gcov plugin supports configuration options via your `project.yml` provided
by Ceedling.

Generation of HTML reports may be enabled or disabled with the following
config. Set to `true` to enable or set to `false` to disable.

```
:gcov:
  :html_report: true
```

Generation of XML reports may be enabled or disabled with the following
config. Set to `true` to enable or set to `false` to disable.

```
:gcov:
  :xml_report: true
```

There are two types of gcovr HTML reports that can be configured in your
`project.yml`. To create a basic HTML report, with only the overall file
information, use the following config.

```
:gcov:
  :html_report_type: basic
```

To create a detailed HTML report, with line by line breakdown of the
coverage, use the following config.

```
:gcov:
  :html_report_type: detailed
```

These HTML and XML reports will be found in `build/artifacts/gcov`.

It is possible to allow gcov to check the coverage percentage of the source
files and exit Ceedling with an error. Use the following config; both are
optional and are not exclusive, and can control the coverage by line or
by branch, expressed in percentage value:

```
:gcov:
  :fail_under_line: 85
  :fail_under_branch: 90
```

## Example Usage

```
ceedling gcov:all utils:gcov
```

## To-Do list

- Generate overall report (combined statistics from all files with coverage)
- Generate coverage output files
- Easier option override for better customisation
